Families Learning Together
Families Learning Together (FLT) is a digital inclusion project in Central Texas that teaches web literacy by making AR/VR stories and games. 

FLT takes an ecological approach to inclusion: literacy is not an individual accomplishment but a way of being that takes root in communities of learners. Rather than position learners as isolated individuals, we design side-by-side learningâ€”kids, families, and teachers together. 

FLT wants to draw out and materialize the affect of inclusion by identifying indicators of inclusion. This goal is fueled by an odd question: What do connectivity, responsibility, interactivity, and fluency feel like? We think the answer to that question informs our approach to digital openness and web literacy.
